## 📌 Project Description

Phishing is a growing cybersecurity threat that tricks users into revealing sensitive data. This project aims to create a **Phishing Detection Tool** that can:
- Detect suspicious activities in real-time
- Analyze multiple indicators of phishing
- Alert users before they fall into a trap

The tool applies core **OOP concepts** such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction** to structure its components effectively.

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Concepts in Use

| Concept        | Application                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation  | Secure handling of data within classes using getters/setters |
| Inheritance    | `PhishingCheck` superclass extended by specific analyzers     |
| Polymorphism   | Overloaded and overridden methods for `analyze()`             |
| Abstraction    | Abstract base classes and interfaces hide complex logic       |
